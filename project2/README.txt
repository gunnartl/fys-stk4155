README file

The exercises in project 2 can be found as follows:

Regression part:

a) forsøkåfårstå.py produses most of the figures in the regression part of the project

b) Calculating the 1d energies is done in energycalc.py lines 40- 50 need to be commented out. d) The neural network part 
is also found here from line 54 - 77. A neural network is created with 
training data, target values, number of hidden nodes and learning rate eta. earlystopping is called from the class classymlp and return number of epochs and MSE of one epoch for a given number of epochs. 
This is set in earlystopping function. The error is also calculated on test data.   

Classification part:
c) logistic regression starts at line 125 and ends at 188. This is with all plots produced in report. The neural network begins at 191 - 202 where the MLP object is created and earlystopping is called for different hidden nodes and learning rates.
